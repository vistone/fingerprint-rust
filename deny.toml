# * warn - A warning will be produced, but the check will not fail
# * allow - No warning or error will be produced, though in some cases a note
# will be

# If 1 or more target triples (and optionally, target_features) are specified,
# only the specified targets will be checked when running `cargo deny check`.
# This means, if a particular package is only ever used as a target specific
# dependency, such as, for example, the `nix` crate only being used via the
# `target_family = "unix"` configuration, that only having windows targets in
# this list would mean the nix crate, as well as any of its exclusive
# dependencies not shared by any other crates, would be ignored, as the target
# list here is effectively saying which targets you are building for.

# When creating the dependency graph used as the source of truth when checks are

# they are connected to another crate in the graph that hasn't been pruned,
# so it should be used with care. The identifiers are [Package ID Specifications]
